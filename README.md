Simple game of chess. That's my first Java app :)  
  
Roadmap:  
✓ 1. Proper object and interface hierarchies  
✓ 2. Basic moves implementation   
☐ 3. Special moves implementation (castles, en passant, promotion)  
☐ 4. Check, checkmate and stalemate detection  
☐ 5. Multi-threading basic structure  
☐ 6. GUI  
☐ 7. Multi-threading full implementation  
☐ 8. Position evaluation  
☐ 9. Min-max AI implementation  
☐ 10. Alpha-beta AI upgrade  
  
Also considering a FEN//PGN parser, saving and loading from a file.
