Simple game of chess. That's my first Java app :)  
  
Roadmap:  
✓ 1. Proper object and interface hierarchies  
✓ 2. Basic moves implementation   
✓ 3. Promotion implementation 
✓ 4. Check detection *** class ready -> implementing into main structure  
☐ 5. Castling  
☐ 6. En passant  
☐ 7. Checkmate and stalemate detection  
☐ 8. Endgame conditions and game loop  
☐ 9. AI game loop   
☐ 10. Position evaluation  
☐ 11. Min-max AI implementation   

--- AI testing ---  

After that in unknown order:  

☐ ?. Multi-threading basic structure  
☐ ?. GUI  
☐ ?. Multi-threading full implementation   
☐ ?. Alpha-beta AI upgrade  
  
Also considering a FEN//PGN parser, saving and loading from a file. Maybe online multiplayer? :)
