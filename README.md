Simple game of chess. That's my first Java app :)

Roadmap:
✓ 1. Proper object and interface hierarchies 
✓ 2. Basic moves implementation 
☐ 3. Special moves implementation (castles, en passant, promotion)
☐ 4. Check, checkmate and stalemate detection
☐ 5. GUI
☐ 6. Position evaluation
☐ 7. Min-max AI implementation
☐ 8. Alpha-beta AI upgrade

Also considering a FEN//PGN parser, saving and loading from a file.
